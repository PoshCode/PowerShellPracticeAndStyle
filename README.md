### What are Best Practices

_PowerShell Best Practices_ are what you should usually do as a starting point. They are ways of writing, thinking, and designing which make it _harder_ to get into trouble. The point of a _Best Practice_ is to help the reader to fall into the pit of success:

> **The Pit of Success:** in stark contrast to a summit, a peak, or a journey across a desert to find victory through many trials and surprises, we want our customers to simply fall into winning practices by using our platform and frameworks.  To the extent that we make it easy to get into trouble we fail.

> -- Rico Mariani, MS Research MindSwap Oct 2003.

Like English spelling and grammar rules, PowerShell programming best practices and style rules nearly always have exceptions, but we are documenting a baseline for code structure, command design, programming, formatting, and even style which will help you to avoid common problems, and help you write more reusable, readable code -- because reusable code doesn't have to be rewritten, and readable code can be maintained.

Having said that, remember: the points in the Best Practices documents and the Style Guide are referred to as _practices_ and _guidelines_, not rules. If you're having trouble getting something done because you're trying to avoid _breaking_ a style or best practice rule, you've misunderstood the point: this document is pragmatic, rather than dogmatic. We'll leave dogmatism to teams and projects that require you to meet their specific guidelines.

### Current State:

Remember [what we mean by _Best Practices_](#what-are-best-practices)

The *PowerShell Best Practices* are always evolving, and continue to be edited and updated as the language and tools (and our community understanding of them) evolve. We encourage you to check back for new editions at least twice a year, by visiting https://github.com/PoshCode/PowerShellPracticeAndStyle

The *PowerShell Style Guide* in particular is in PREVIEW, and we are still actively working out our disagreements about the rules in the guide through the github issues system.
