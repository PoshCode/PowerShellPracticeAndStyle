TODO

#### Control what gets exported in a module
#### Specify when to use a Manifest for a module

#### Use RequiredAssemblies rather than Add-Type
#### Use Add-Type rather than Reflection
Avoid using `[System.Reflection]` to load assemblies when possible. Particularly avoid `LoadWithPartialName` (specify the full name instead).

#### Use Add-Type for small classes or PInvoke calls
TODO: Is this better than PowerShell classes, for compatibility?

#### Prefer shipping binaries over large compilations
With PowerShell 5, security is tighter, and compiling code in memory will be frowned upon. Now that we have PowerShellGet and the PowerShell Gallery, there are few reasons or no reason to avoid binaries.

TODO: Discuss: when does embedding C# code makes more sense than just compiling it every time?

### Performance

#### Prefer language features over cmdlets
Prefer foreach(){} over ForEach-Object
Prefer .foreach and .where over cmdlets
Prefer functions with process blocks over ForEach-Object

#### Know when to use .NET
Prefer writing wrapper functions to just calling .NET APIs
Discuss: System.IO file loading vs Get-Content (large files)
Discuss: Other examples of .NET API calls that are clearly faster?
Discuss: Casting for creating objects

### Error Handling

TODO
Discuss: Avoid depending on `$?` -- why?
Discuss: Never use `$Error` in scripts (always use -ErrorVariable)
Discuss: Interactively, always copy $Error[0] to $e or something

### General Design Principles

#### Use custom objects
Discuss: Add-Type vs PowerShell classes vs creating PSCustomObjects
Discuss: Casting for creating objects
Discuss: PSTypeNames and formatting rules

#### Scripts vs Functions
Discuss: In PowerShell 3+, performance is such that there's very little penalty for using scripts.
Discuss: In PowerShell 3+, module autoloading means there's no discoverability penalty for writing functions (if you put them in a module) instead (except loading sets of them at a time).
Discuss: During development, always write scripts, which are automatically re-parsed if you edit the file.

#### Always write CmdletBinding

This is in the Style Guide too, but we should discuss it in more depth here, and link to it from the Style Guide.  Scripts should start life as something like this:

```
[CmdletBinding()]
param()
process{}
end{}
```

You can always ignore one of the blocks, and add parameters and such, but you should never write a script without CmdletBinding, and you should never write one without at least considering making it take pipeline input

### Include Help

TODO: Link to StyleGuide about formatting help
Discuss: Minimum acceptable comment-based help: Synopsis, Parameters, and an example for each parameter set (plus pipeline examples if you can contrive one)
Discuss: Benefits of MAML help files

#### Always ship an about_ModuleName with modules

Discuss: Other reasons to write about_topics

#### Prefer PipelineByPropertyName parameters.
Discuss: This allows the most flexibility: piping objects and using scriptblocks to shape it for parameters. Unless you absolutely need to write a `begin` block and use this parameter in it, you probably should accept it on the pipeline.

Discuss: There is some testing overhead involved in that decision.

Discuss: You MUST do all your work in the process block if you do this.

#### Specify aliases for pipeline binding
You can use aliases to map parameters to property names of objects which might be piped to you while still keeping your parameter names clear and meaningful.

#### Never forget the Common Parameters
Particularly when splatting PSBoundParameters to the next function, if that function isn't `[CmdletBinding()]` (it should be!) you must remember to strip the common parameters if they're present.

#### Specify positional parameters, but don't use them
When writing at the command line, positional parameters are a blessing, but they can be confusing for future readers. You should always expose your parameters positionally when it makes sense, but you should rarely share a script that passes parameters positionally.

#### Specify short aliases, but don't use them
Again, for the sake of typing, it's particularly useful if you can provide two-letter aliases for each of your parameters such that every parameter has a two-letter or less name which is unique.

#### Never specify Default values for mandatory parameters
It doesn't do anything, and it confuses future readers.

#### Always specify HelpText for mandatory parameters
When prompted for a mandatory parameter, a user can request HelpText, but can't look at the documentation. It's frequently useful to duplicate at least the first sentence or two of the parameter help.

```
[Parameter(Position = 1, Mandatory = $true, ValueFromPipeline = $true,
ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName = $true, HelpText = 'The name of the file to read')]
[Alias('PSPath','FullName','Path')]
[String]$File
```

#### Use PsCmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError rather than throw
#### Use PsCmdlet.WriteError rather than Write-Error
Discuss: These need example output to explain why they're better
Discuss: a common template (from the Microsoft team) for throwing errors

```
# Utility to throw an error record
function ThrowError {
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
        [System.Management.Automation.PSCmdlet]
        $CallerPSCmdlet,

        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
        [System.String]
        $ExceptionName,

        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
        [System.String]
        $ExceptionMessage,
        
        [System.Object]
        $ExceptionObject,
        
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
        [System.String]
        $ErrorId,

        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [ValidateNotNull()]
        [System.Management.Automation.ErrorCategory]
        $ErrorCategory
    )
        
    $exception = New-Object -TypeName $ExceptionName -ArgumentList $ExceptionMessage
    $errorRecord = New-Object System.Management.Automation.ErrorRecord $exception, $ErrorId, $ErrorCategory, $ExceptionObject
    $CallerPSCmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError($errorRecord)
}
```

#### Use SupportsShouldProcess when appropriate
Discuss: when is this critical (-WhatIf) and optional (-Confirm)
Discuss: when should you call $PSCmdlet.ShouldProcess vs $PSCmdlet.ShouldContinue (-Force)

```
[CmdletBinding(SupportsShouldProcess = $true, ConfirmImpact = "Medium")]
param([Switch]$Force)

$RejectAll = $false
$ConfirmAll = $false

foreach ($file in ls) {

   if($PSCmdlet.ShouldProcess("Removed the file '$($file.Name)'",
                               "Remove the file '$($file.Name)'?",
                               "Removing Files")
   ) {

      if ($Force -Or $PSCmdlet.ShouldContinue("Are you REALLY sure you want to remove '$($file.Name)'?", "Removing '$($file.Name)'", [ref]$ConfirmAll, [ref]$RejectAll)) {
         "Removing $File"


      }
   }
}
```

#### Modules ARE the Best Practice
Discuss: Scope isolation, hiding helper functions, sharing state between functions
Discuss: Organizing related functions
Discuss: Discoverability, Packaging, Sharing
Discuss: Dependency Management, Versioning
Discuss: Internationalization

#### Use RequiredModules
The problems with this have gone away with autoloading, and this is the only way to let PowerShellGet manage dependencies for you.

#### Persisting Configuration
My choice: Configuration module. Otherwise, use clixml (or XAML) to persist to AppData (TEST: you shouldn't store configuration in your module folder, as it may not survive upgrades (in PowerShell 3 & 4 there was no side-by-side loading))

#### Provide aliases in your modules
You should feel free to create and use aliases within your modules. In some cases, you can even improve readability by using an alias without the verb, or shortening command names.

For exported aliases, follow the guidance of Microsoft ("ip" for import, "s" for set, "g" for get, "r" for remove, etc.), make up something for your nouns.

Use `New-Alias ... -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` to avoid overwriting existing aliases.

### GOTCHAS

#### Beware of string concatenation with +
You should always wrap this with parentheses, because otherwise it can break (e.g., when passing a string as a parameter).

#### Beware of -match and -like
They quietly cast objects to strings (or arrays of strings)

#### Beware of -contains and -in
They work on ARRAYS, not strings

### Use Language Features
When writing scripts (as opposed to at the command line), you should almost always choose language features over cmdlets. This includes using `if` instead of `Where-Object`, `foreach` instead of `ForEach-Object`, etc.

The language features are always faster, and almost always more readable. Of course, there are always exceptions, and one exception to this rule is when using `foreach` will force you to collect a lot of items into an array instead of iterating them as they stream through a pipeline.

### You should understand the .NET underpinnings

#### AVOID appending to string in a loop
##### INSTEAD assign output from the loop using $OFS
#### EXCEPTIONS:
* When it's a really short loop

#### RATIONALE:
* Copying is slow
* Joining an array of strings is fast
* Easier to read and understand

### Strongly typed parameters
Although PowerShell is a dynamic language, we can specify types, and in parameters, it's particularly useful because it hints to users what they can pass to your command.

Strong types on parameters is also crucial because it's a user-input point. Strong types can help you avoid script injection and various other problems with user inputs, and will allow failures to happen as early as possible (even before your command is called).

Additionally, avoid using `[string]` with ParameterSets because anything can be cast to it, so PowerShell can't distinguish one parameter set from the other.

When passing on parameters to another command, they should be _at least_ as strongly typed as the other command, to avoid casting exceptions within your script.

One notable exception is when you could accept more than one type. In PowerShell you can specify parameter set overloads, but you can't change the type of a parameter.
